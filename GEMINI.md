# Gemini CLI Extension: std-skills

This extension provides a collection of standard skills for the Gemini CLI.

## Project Structure

- `skills/`: Contains the individual skills.

## Configuration

- `gemini-extension.json`: Extension metadata for Gemini CLI.

## Workflows

### GEMINI.md Maintenance
**CRITICAL:** This `GEMINI.md` file must be actively maintained by any agent working on this extension. It serves as the primary repository for project-specific operational intelligence, developer notes, and conventions. Update it whenever new workflows, gotchas, or structural patterns are introduced.

### README Maintenance
When adding a new skill to the `skills/` directory:
1. Update the `Available Skills` section in `README.md`.
2. Include the skill name, a brief description, and its primary trigger phrases.
3. Provide the specific installation and linking commands for that skill, matching the existing examples.

### Adding a New Skill
Create a new directory in `skills/` with a `SKILL.md` file following the kebab-case naming convention.
